Welcome to the Simba documentation!
===================================

.. note::

    Welcome to the Documentation for the Simba project.
    The documentation is actively being worked on and somewhat incomplete.

This documentation aims to provide information on just about anything
there is to know about Simba.

Starting points are :ref:`whatis`, :ref:`gettingstarted` and the :ref:`scriptref`

Want to help out with the documentation? See :ref:`docdoc`.


Simba is a program used to repeat certain (complicated) tasks. Typically these
tasks involve using the mouse and keyboard. Simba is programmable, which means
you can design your own logic and steps that Simba will follow, based upon
certain input or as a reaction to a certain action.

Simba is created by the SRL community, fully open source and actively
maintained.

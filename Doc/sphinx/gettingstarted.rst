Getting Started with Simba
==========================

This page will help you install Simba and highlight some basic Simba
features.

Installing simba
----------------

Installing Simba is pretty straightforward and will only take a couple of
minutes.

.. _simba-installer:

Simba installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone can get Simba at http://wizzup.org/simba/

Go to *Download* and download the Simba installer.

Once it is done downloading, simply run the installer, follow the steps and
please make notice of the following note:

.. note::
    Simba will install to C:/ by default; if you want to install it
    somewhere else, make sure you select a different location!
    If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, then you will probably want
    to install it to C:/ or another place; as long as writing in the actual
    directory does not require administrator permissions. C:/ is a safe bet.

    You can install Simba to your ``Program Files`` directory, but you will have
    to run Simba as administrator in that case.

Simba will probably tell you there is an update available. In this case, an
update button will appear. Click it and the Simba Updater will show up.
Alternatively you can update Simba using Tools -> Update which will update Simba
if there is a new update available.

.. note::
    Updating Simba as soon as an update is released is recommended.

Portable Simba Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..
    TODO

To get a portable installation at this time is not supported but will follow
sooner or later.

Setting up SRL 4 with Simba
---------------------------

If you were using the :ref:`simba-installer` then you can simply enable the
``SRL Updater`` extension. (Go to View -> Extensions and enable ``srl.sex``)

See :ref:`simbaext` for more information on (other) Simba extensions.

This is the only supported way. You can simply do a svn checkout on the srl
repository, but if you can do that, then you should be able to set up SRL
yourself as well.

Setting up SRL 5 with Simba
---------------------------

This will follow later, upon SRL 5 release.

Installing scripts
------------------

..
    TODO

Scripts can be downloaded with the Script Manager, in Tools -> Script Manager.

.. note::
    The Script Manager is not finished yet.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you run into problems that are not mentioned here, make sure you look at
the :ref:`Troubleshooting` page.

Troubleshooting
===============

This is a general troubleshooting page and will hopefully cover all potential
problems you may encounter.

Where is the DTM Editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DTM Editor a Simba Extension. See :ref:`simbaext` for more information on
extensions and how to enable the DTM editor.

Where are my Extensions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All extensions are in the *Extensions* folder. If this folder is empty, you may
need to manually download the Extensions or reinstall Simba.

Simba crashes on start complaining about settings.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This means your settings.xml has become corrupt somehow, or Simba may not be
able to create it. If a settings.xml exists in your Simba directory, you can
delete it. (All your settings will be lost, but this shouldn't be a big deal)

Note that this should no longer happen with Simba 750 and up.

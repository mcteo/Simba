Simba Extensions
================

Simba extensions are exactly what the name suggests: Extensions for Simba. These
extensions vary from updaters to firewalls and design tools.

By default all extensions are disabled. They reside in the *Extensions*
folder and end with ``.sex``. To enable or disable Extensions go to Tools >
Extensions. There you will find a list of all extensions.
